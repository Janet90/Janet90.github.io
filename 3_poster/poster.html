            <h1>An App Called you</h1>
            <p>The ear favors no particular "point of view". We are enveloped by sound. It forms a seamless web around us. We say, "Music shall fill the air". We never say, "Music shall fill a particular segment of the air".
            We hear sounds from everywhere, without ever having to focus. Sounds came from "above", from "below", from "in front" of us, from "behind" us, from our "right", from our "left".
            We can't shut out sound automatically. We simply are not quipped with earlids.
            Where a visual space is an organised continuum of a uniform connected kind, the ear world is a world of simultaneous relationships.</p>
