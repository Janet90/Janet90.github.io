        Scraping the Social: “We are unknown to ourselves—and with good reason.” <br />Friedrich Nietzsche—“Even the retards are starting to figure it out.”(comment)—“In data we trust.” Priceonomics—“The Internet fails to scale gracefully.” Chris Ellis—“I want to be surprised by my own bot”—“There is a crack in everything.
         That’s how the light gets in.” Leo­­nard Cohen—“Just did my sheepish biannual LinkedIn visit, which felt too much like my sheepish biannual sweeping of dry cleaner
         hangers into the bin.” Dayo Olopade—Organic Reach Technologies (company)—“It’s not a pilot study. It’s small batch artisanal data.” @AcademicsSay—“No Reply”
         The Beatles—“A Facebook-Op occurs when one takes a photo just to upload it to Facebook later.”
         <br />Urban Dictionary—“If you start to think that people are awful,
         you can always sign on to Twitter. Get some further proof. Then go on about your day.” Nein—“The right people can work around a bad technology, but the wrong
         people will mess up even a good one.” Kentaro Toyama—“My secrets won’t make you happier.”
         <br />Amalia Ulman—“You can wake up now, the universe has ended.”
         Jim Stark—“Stop treating internet like it’s a different thing and start focusing on what you actually want your society to look like. We have to fix society,
         before we can fix the internet.”
         <br />Peter Sunde—“We may be decentralised and disagree on a lot of topics amongst ourselves, but operations are always carefully coordinated.”
          Anonymous—#Apply: The same boiling water that softens potatoes, hardens eggs—“Insults from complete strangers. This is the true promise of social media.”
          Neil—“How valuable is reputation if any idiot off the street can rate me?” #peeple—Social media or “how to turn our thoughts violently towards the present

          Contradictory consciousness-management has superseded social anxiety about Bad Faith. This has long been the thesis of Slavoj Žižek. Let’s work on
          this thesis and take seriously the cynical statement “They know what they do, but they do it anyway” and apply this to social media. There is no longer a
          need to investigate the potential of “new media” and deconstruct their intentions. The internet has reached its hegemonic stage. In previous decades
          it was premature to associate intensive 24/7 usage by millions with deep structures such as the (sub)conscious. Now that we live fully in social media
          times, it has become pertinent to do precisely that: link techne with psyche.

          The revelations of Edward Snowden arrived long after our daily surf-and-swap routines had become firmly entrenched. We know we’re watched by
          surveillance systems but who can honesty claim to constantly be aware of them? Artistic masks are promoted as protective face shields—yet who wears them?
            The internet may be broken, as the phrase goes (and IT engineers have reached a consensus about this troubling analysis), but this cannot be said of social media.
            2 Like Snowden’s revelations, Sherry Turkle’s evidence about smartphones inhibiting one’s empathy and ability to enjoy the virtues of solitude have arrived
            late in the social media game.3 How hard has it become to confront offline boredom? It’s a straight-up torture.<br />

          The slogan “You are what you share” (Charles Leadbeater) expresses the transformation of the autonomous unit of the self into an outgoing entity that is
            constantly reproducing its social capital through the transmission of value (data) to others. Let’s face it: we refuse to perceive ourselves as “slaves of
            the machine.” What does it mean when we all agree that there is an addictive element to today’s social media use, yet none of us is apparently addicted?
            Are we really returning only sporadically?4 What exactly is being captured here? If anything, we’re encapsulated by the social sphere as such, not by the
            software, nor by the protocols, network architectures, or the assuredly infantile interfaces.
          </div>

          <div class="tc-3">
            Under this spell of desire for the social, led by the views and opinions of our immediate social circle, our daily routines are as follows:
              view recent stories first, fine-tune filter preferences, jump to first unread,update your life with events, clear and refresh all, not now, save
              links to read for later, see full conversation, mute your ex, set up a secret board, run a poll, comment through the social plug-in, add video to your
              profile,choose between love, haha, wow, sad, and angry, engage with those who mention you while tracking the changes in relationship status of others,
              follow a key opinion leader, receive notifications, create a photo spread that links to your avatar, repost a photo, get lost in the double-barrel river
              of your timeline, prevent friends from seeing updates, check out something based on a recommendation, customize cover images, create “must-click” headlines,
              chat with a friend while noticing that “1,326,595 people like this topic.”

             Social networking is much more than just a dominant discourse. We need to go beyond text and images and include its software, interfaces, and networks
              that depend on a technical infrastructure consisting of offices and their consultants and cleaners, cables and data centers, working in close concert with
              the movements and habits of the connected billions. Academic internet studies circles have shifted their attention from utopian promises, impulses,
              and critiques to “mapping” the network’s impact. From digital humanities to data science we see a shift in network-oriented inquiry from Whether and Why,
              What and Who, to (merely) How. From a sociality of causes to a sociality of net effects. A new generation of humanistic researchers is lured into the
              “big data” trap, and kept busy capturing user behavior whilst producing seductive eye candy for an image-hungry audience (and vice versa).
            </div>
            <div class="text">
            Without noticing, we have arrived at a new, yet unnamed, stage: the hegemonic era of social media platforms as ideology. Products and services are
              of course usually subject to ideology. We have learned to “read” ideology into them. But at what point can we convincingly say they have become
              ideology themselves? It is one thing to state that Mark Zuckerberg (founder of Facebook) is an ideologue, working in the service of US intelligence agencies,
               or to document community or political groups using his social media platform in ways unplanned or counter to expectations inherent to its design.
               It is quite another to work on a comprehensive social media theory. It is a crucial time for critical theory to reclaim lost territory and bring on exactly
               this: a shift from the quantitative to the qualitative, uncomputable impacts of this ubiquitous formatting of the social. It is liberating for research
               to sever itself from the instrumental approach of (viral) marketing and public relations. Stop pushing, start analyzing. Network technologies are rapidly
               becoming the “new normal,” withdrawing their operations and governance from view. We need to politicize the New Electricity, the privately owned utilities
               of our century, before they disappear into the background.

            The 2008 chapter of internet criticism is coming to a close. For the next round of The Critique of the Political Economy, the internet and digital technologies will have to be fully integrated. The easy opposition of California utopians vs. Euro pessimists has been superseded by much larger planetary issues such as the future of work. We need to take internet critique beyond the normative regulation of behavior and politicize the anxiety of the youth and their particular addictions and distractions. We have long come to terms with the actual and virtual nature of the social, as its potential for play and manipulation seems increasingly in abeyance. Social media demand from us that we perform in a never-ending show. We keep coming back, always remaining logged in, until the #DigitalDetox sets in and we’re called to different realms.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
            The social, political, and economic promise of the internet as a decentralized network of networks lies in tatters. Social media alternatives, five years after their initial appearance, haven’t made much progress at all.5 Despite all well-intended critical predictions, the herds have not moved on to greener pastures.  <br /> The overall picture is one of stagnation in a field defined by the corporate domination of a handful of players. We all remain stuck in the social media mud, and it’s time to ask why. Comparable to the late-1970s stagnation in mainstream media critique, a political economy approach will not be sufficient if we want to come up with workable strategies. One possible way out could be a post-Freudian answer to the question: What’s on a User’s Mind?6 We need to answer the question as to what social media actually offer.   <br /> Which desires do they appeal to?   <br />Why is updating such a seductive yet boring habit?   <br />Can we develop a set of critical concepts that would describe our compulsive <br /> attraction to social media, without reducing  that  attraction to  addiction rhetoric?

            <br />
            A starting point for reading social media as ideology would be Wendy Chun’s 2004 essay on the idea of “software” as ideology.7 Chun’s work, along with the work of Jodi Dean and others, speaks strongly to the media theorist coming to terms with the peak of neoliberal transition and the triumph of proprietary software. The prominence of ideology as a central term in debates has faded away since the mid-1980s. The backdrop of ideology theory in the 1970s was the spectacular peaking of the power of the state apparatus (also called the welfare state) that was commissioned to administrate the postwar class compromise. Whilst Daniel Bell’s End of Ideology, as announced in 1960, had arrived with the victory of neoliberalism at the end of the Cold War, there was an intuitive feeling that ideology—with a small i—had not yet left the stage, and the World Without Ideas was not yet within reach, despite concerted efforts to diminish the role of public intellectuals and critical discourses.</p>
          </div>
            <div class="tc-3">
            The “Californian ideology” as defined in 1995 by Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron helped us trace the motives underlying the internet back to their Cold War roots (and the ambivalent hippie culture). Fred Turner’s 2006 classic From Counterculture to Cyberculture did much the same. But the historical perspective is not much use if it cannot explain social media’s contemporary and persistent success since the 1990s. Now, as in the 1970s, the role of ideology in navigating the limits of existing systems is all too real. To study ideology is to take a close look at this everyday life, here and now. What remains particularly unexplained is the apparent paradox between the hyper-individualized subject and the herd mentality of the social. What’s wrong with the social? What’s right with it? Positivity is as pervasive in California as it is in the Italian cyberspace scene, which, in a Gramscian move, has embraced the “social network” as a sign within popular culture that the multitude can beat the mainstream in its act of mediation. Italian critics, activists, and artists are not unlike many others in being hyperaware of all the controversies that surround the products and services made in Silicon Valley, while remaining mostly positive about the magic potion called social networking.

            One function of ideology as defined by Louis Althusser is recognition, the (in)famous interpellation of the subject that is being called upon.7 We can apply this and speak of the process of becoming-user. This is the unnoticed part of the social media saga. Before we enter the social media sphere, everyone first fills out a profile and choses a username and password in order to create an account. Minutes later, you’re part of the game and you start sharing, creating, playing, as if it has always been like that. The profile is the a priori part and the profiling and targeted advertising cannot operate without it. The platforms present themselves as self-evident. They just are—facilitating our feature-rich lives. Everyone that counts is there. It is through the gate of the profile that we become its subject.
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            For Althusser, we live inside ideology in this way—the formula applies in particular to social media in which subjects are addressed as users who do not exist without a profile. It is justified to use this slightly authoritarian, hermetic concept of ideology because of the highly centralized top-down structure of social media architecture in this age of platform capitalism, which leaves zero space for users to reprogram their communication spaces.

            Despite all the postmodernism and cynical neoliberalism that has deemed it redundant, it is no surprise that ideology (again) rules. (It is more remarkable how total the concept’s fall from use has been.) The main issue is that we are less and less aware of how it rules. When it comes to social media we have an “enlightened false consciousness” in which we know very well what we are doing when we are fully sucked in, but we do it anyway. This even accounts at a meta-level for the popularity of Žižek’s insights—and could be one of the best explanations for his success. We’re all aware of the algorithmic manipulations of Facebook’s news feed, the filter-bubble effect in apps, and the persuasive presence of personalized advertisement. We pull in updates, 24/7, in a real-time global economy of interdependencies, having been taught to read news feeds as interpersonal indicators of the planetary condition. So in what way does Louis Althusser need updating?

            Four decades after the Althusser era, we do not associate ideology with the state in the same way he and his followers did. To qualify Facebook and Google as falling within the Althusserian definition of “ideological state apparatus” sounds odd, if not exotic. In this era of late neoliberalism and right-wing populism, ideology is associated with the market, not with the state, which has withdrawn into the role of merely securing the market. But lest we forget, it was ideology theory itself that contributed to the “crisis of marxism.” It led the way in opening up marxism to issues thrust to the fore by the student movement, the rise of feminism, and other “new social movements,” and also highlighted the stagnation and bankruptcy of the Soviet Union. The growing interest in media and “cultural studies” did the rest.
          </div>
          <div class="tc-3">

            When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, weakened Communist parties could no longer “annex” and overrule the rainbow of justice and redistribution issues of the “properly” (or revolutionary) social state, let alone its countercultural practices. The tactics of overdetermination in the name of the working class therefore no longer worked. The so-called “patchwork of minorities,” non-applying themselves to the new normal, were left literally to their own devices, without an overarching political framework, let alone organization (or antagonism). Within a decade, two of the defining centripetal forces of Marxist theory as ideology critique lost their dominance: State and Party. The associated disappearance of ideology as a main focus of attention in philosophy and the social sciences turned into the common belief that while “ideas still mattered,” they are no longer able to rule people’s lives. Nowadays, ideas are praised because they can shape the future, but taken as rules and norms they are believed to be too messy to govern our contradictory everyday lives under capital.

            Treating social media as ideology means observing how it binds together media, culture, and identity into an ever-growing cultural performance (and related “cultural studies”) of gender, lifestyle, fashion, brands, celebrity, and news from radio, television, magazines, and the web—all of this imbricated with the entrepreneurial values of venture capital and start-up culture, with their underside of declining livelihoods and growing inequality. Every user has their confession: “It’s definitely harder to avoid social media than it is to give into it. Most people tend to give into it, because its easier” (Adele).Wendy Chun wrote her 2004 essay on software as ideology in the golden 2.0 era of the web, when software was coming to be considered synonymous with—and confused with—PCs and laptops. She wrote: “Software is a functional analogue to ideology. In a formal sense computers understood as comprising software and hardware are ideology machines.” She noted that software “fulfills almost every formal definition of ideology we have, from ideology as false consciousness to Louis Althusser’s definition of ideology as a ‘representation’ of the imaginary relation of individuals to their real conditions of existence.’” In an age of installed, micro-perceptual effects and streamed programming, ideology does not merely refer to an abstract sphere where the battle of ideas is being fought. Think more in line with a Spinozan sense of embodiment—from the repetitive strains of Tinder swiping, to text neck, to the hunched-over-laptop syndrome.
          </div>
          <div class="tc-3">

            What is crusted as orthodoxy in Althusser needs some adaptation and updating, not only in terms of a class analysis. But it is still remarkable how smoothly an Althusserian ideology framework fits today’s world, as Chun proves:
            Software, or perhaps more precisely operating systems, offer us an imaginary relationship to our hardware: they do not represent transistors but rather desktops and recycling bins. Software produces users. Without operating system (OS) there would be no access to hardware; without OS no actions, no practices, and thus no user. Each OS, through its advertisements, interpellates a “user”: calls it and offers it a name or image with which to identify.
            We could say that social media performs the same function, and is even more powerful.
            “What are you doing?” said Twitter’s original phrase. The question marks the material roots of social media. Social media platforms have never asked “What are you thinking?” Or dreaming, for that matter. Twentieth-century libraries are full of novels, diaries, comic strips, and films in which people expressed what are were thinking. In the age of social media we seem to confess less what we think. It’s considered too risky, too private. We share what we do, and see, in a staged manner. Yes, we share judgments and opinions, but no thoughts. Our Self is too busy for that, always on the move, flexible, open, sporty, sexy, and always ready to connect and express.
            With 24/7 social visibility, apparatus and application become one in the body. This is a reversal of Marshall McLuhan’s Extensions of Man—we are now witnessing an Inversion of Man. Once technology entangles our senses and gets under our skin, distance collapses and we no longer have any sense that we are bridging distances. <br />With Jean Baudrillard we could speak of an implosion of the social into the hand-held device in which an unprecedented accumulation of storage capacity, computational power, software, and social capital is crystallized. <br />Things get right in our face, our ears, steered by our autonomous finger tips. This is what Michel Serres admires so much in the navigational plasticity of the mobile generation, the smoothness of its gestures, symbolized in the speed of the thumb, sending updates in seconds, mastering mini-conversations, grasping the mood of a global tribe in an instant. <br />To stay within the French realm of references: social media as the apparatus of sexy and sporty “active acting” makes it a perfect vehicle for the literature of despair epitomized by Michel Houellebecq’s messy body(-politics). <br />The illusion with which the user surrounds him- or herself while swiping and tapping through social media updates feels natural and self-evident for the very first time.<br /> There is no steep learning curve or rite of passage; we need not shed blood, sweat, and tears to fight our way into the social hierarchy.

            </div>
            <div class="text">

            From day one the network configuration makes us feel at home, as if WhatsApp, QQ, and Telegram have always existed. Down the line, however, this immediate familiarity becomes the main source of discontent. We’re no longer playing, like in the good old days of LamdaMOO and Second Life. Intuitively, we sense that social media constitute an arena of struggle where we display our “experientalism” (James Wallman), where hierarchy is a given, and profile details such as gender, race, age, and class are not merely “data” but decisive measures in the social stratification ladder.

            Social media’s imaginary community that we stumble into (and leave behind the moment we log out) is not fake. The platform is not a simulacrum of the social. Social media do not “mask” the real. Neither the software nor the interface of social media are ironic, multilayered, or complex. In that sense, social media are no longer (or not yet) postmodern. The paradoxes at work here are not playful. The applications do not appear to us as absurd, let alone Dada. They are self-evident, functional, even slightly boring. What attracts us is the social, the never-ending flow, and not the performativity of the interfaces themselves. (Performativity seems to be the main draw of virtual realty, now in its second hype cycle, twenty-five years after its first).

            Networks are not merely arenas of competition among rival social forces. This is a far too idealized point of view. If only. What fails here is the “staging” element. Platforms are not stages; they bring together and synthesize (multimedia) data, yes, but what is lacking here is the (curatorial) element of human labor. That’s why there is no media in social media. The platforms operate because of their software, automated procedures, algorithms, and filters, not because of their large staff of editors and designers. Their lack of employees is what makes current debates in terms of racism, anti-Semitism, and jihadism so timely, as social media platforms are currently forced by politicians to employ editors who will have to do the all-too-human monitoring work (filtering out ancient ideologies that refuse to disappear).
          </div>
          <div class="tc-4">

            Whereas gadgets such as smartphones and cameras have a (hyped-up and thus limited) fetish quality, the social network as such fails to have such a status. The network has an ecological status, comparable to Sloterdijk’s theory of the spheres. It surrounds us like air; it’s a Lebenswelt, a (filter) bubble, comparable to the medieval worldview or imagined Mars colonies. Today’s cosmology consists of layers made of dating apps, soccer portals, software forums, and porn sites woven together by search engines, news sites, and social media. As in the case of air, it will become quite a task to prove its existence, but once ideology shows its ugly side, therapy works through the unconscious, paradoxes start to fall apart, and the ideology unravels.

            <br />Going back to 2004, Wendy Chun was occupied with the issue of metaphors when taking software seriously as a new kind of social realism: “Software and ideology fit each other perfectly because both try to map the material effects of the immaterial and to posit the immaterial through visible cues. Through this process the immaterial emerges as a commodity, as something in its own right.” <br />The details seem less interesting to deal with: “Users know very well that their folders and desktops are not really folders and desktops, but they treat them as if they were—by referring to them as folders and as desktops. This logic is, according to Slavoj Žižek, crucial to ideology.” <br /> Is it useful to also note that the Facebook category of “friends” has become a similar metaphor. We can surely say the same of the Facebook “news feed.”
          </div>
            <div class="tc-4">
            So, what will happen when the audience becomes too much to deal with? More important than deconstructing surface appearances is, in Chun’s words, to argue that “ideology persists in one’s actions rather than in one’s beliefs. The illusion of ideology exists not at the level of knowledge but rather at the level of doing.” Here, the rhetoric of “interactivity” obfuscates more than it reveals about the way users negotiate interfaces; since the computational and control mechanisms of interfaces are hidden, users cannot technically “interact” with them directly enough to understand them. The like economy “behind” our smart devices is a particularly relevant social media example. What, for instance, will happen when we reveal that we have never believed in our own likes? That we never liked you in the first place?

            Let’s appraise the bots and the like economy for what they are: key features of platform capitalism aimed at capturing value behind the backs of their users. Social media are a matter of neither taste nor lifestyle, in the sense of “consumer choice.” They are our technological mode of the social. In the previous century we would never have regarded writing letters or making a telephone call as matters of taste. They were “cultural techniques,” massive flows of symbolic exchange. Soon after its initial emergence , social media transformed from a hype and online service into essential infrastructure, just like letters and telegrams and the telephone used to be. It is precisely at this juncture of “becoming infrastructure” that we (re)open the ideology file.

          <h2> What is the real impact of social media? </h2>
            <div class="text">
          Information and communication technology has changed rapidly over the past 20 years with a key development being the emergence of social media.
          The pace of change is accelerating. For example, the development of mobile technology has played an important role in shaping the impact of social media. Across the globe, mobile devices dominate in terms of total minutes spent online. This puts the means to connect anywhere, at any time on any device in everyone’s hands.

          <br />Why people share information?
          <br />A fascinating study by New York Times Consumer Insight Group revealed the motivations that participants cited for sharing information on social media. <br />These include a desire to reveal valuable and entertaining content to others; to define themselves; to grow and nourish relationships and to get the word out about brands and causes they like or support.

          These factors have caused social networks to evolve from being a handy means for keeping in touch with friends and family to being used in ways that have a real impact on society.

          Social media is being used in ways that shape politics, business, world culture, education, careers, innovation, and more.


          </div>

          Here are seven ways the impact of social media is felt by individuals and social groups:
          <div class="tc-3">
          1. The effect of social media on politics
          A new study from Pew Research claims that 62 percent of people get their news from social media, with 18 percent doing so very often.
          In comparison to other media, social media’s influence in political campaigns has increased tremendously. Social networks play an increasingly important role in electoral politics in the ultimately unsuccessful candidacy of Howard Dean in 2003, and then in the election of the first African-American president in 2008.

          The New York Times reports that “The election of Donald J. Trump is perhaps the starkest illustration yet that across the planet, social networks are helping to fundamentally rewire human society.” Because social media allows people to communicate with one another more freely, they are helping to create surprisingly influential social organizations among once-marginalized groups.

          <br /><br /><br />2. The impact of social media on society
          Almost a quarter of the world’s population is now on Facebook. In the USA nearly 80% of all internet users are on this platform. Because social networks feed off interactions among people.
          Thanks to the internet, each person with marginal views can see that he’s not alone. And when these people find one another via social media, they can do things — create memes, publications and entire online worlds that bolster their worldview, and then break into the mainstream.
          Without social media, social, ethical, environmental and political ills would have minimal visibility. Increased visibility of issues has shifted the balance of power from the hands of a few to the masses.
          The flipside: Social media is slowly killing real activism and replacing it with ‘slacktivism’
          While social media activism brings an increased awareness about societal issues, questions remain as to whether this awareness is translating into real change.
          Some argue that social sharing has encouraged people to use computers and mobile phones to express their concerns on social issues without actually having to engage actively with campaigns in real life. Their support is limited to pressing the ‘Like’ button or sharing content.
          This is a very human reaction when people are given options that absolve them from responsibility to act. A 2013 study by the University of British Columbia’s Sauder School of Business found that when people are presented with the option of ‘liking’ a social cause, they use this to opt out of actually committing time and money to a charitable cause. On the other hand, when people are allowed to show support in private, they are more likely to show meaningful support in terms of making a financial contribution.
          The researchers found that a public endorsement is an action meant to satisfy others’ opinions, whereas people who give in private do so because the cause is aligned to their values.

          3. The impact of social media on commerce
          The rise of social media means it’s unusual to find an organization that does not reach its customers and prospects through one social media platform or another. Companies see the importance of using social media to connect with customers and build revenue.
          Businesses have realized they can use social media to generate insights, stimulate demand, and create targeted product offerings. This is important in traditional brick-and-motor businesses, and, obviously, in the world of e-commerce.
          Many studies suggest implementing social networks within the workplace can strengthen knowledge sharing. The result is to improve project management activities and enable the spread of specialized knowledge. Fully implementing social technologies in the workplace removes boundaries, eliminates silos, and can raise interaction and help create more highly skilled and knowledgeable workers.
          The flip side: Low number of social ‘shares’ can lead to negative social proof and destroy business credibility
          Interestingly, although the use of social sharing has become the norm rather than the exception in business, some companies, after experiencing first-hand some negative effects of social media, have decided to go against the grain and remove the social sharing buttons from their websites.
          A case study of Taloon.com, an e-commerce retailer from Finland, found that conversions rose by 11.9% when they removed share buttons from their product pages.
          <br />These results highlight the double-edged nature of the impact of social media. When products attract a lot of shares, it can reinforce sales. But when the reverse is true, customers begin to distrust the product and the company. This is what Dr. Paul Marsden, psychologist and author of ‘The Social Commerce Handbook’, referred to as ‘social proof’.<br />

          <br />4. The effects of social media on the world of work
          Social media has had a profound effect on recruitment and hiring. 19 percent of hiring managers make their hiring decisions based on information found on social media.<br /> According to CareerBuilder's 2016 social media recruitment survey, 60 percent of employers use social networking sites to research job candidates.
          Professional social networks such as LinkedIn are important social media platforms for anyone looking to stand out in their profession. They allow people to create and market a personal brand.

        <div class="tc-3">
          5. The impact of social media on Training and Development
          Job candidates who develop skills on the latest and most advanced social media techniques are far more employable.
          A 2013 survey by Pearson Learning Solutions reported a significant increase in the use of social media in learning. Over half the educators who were interviewed agreed that social sharing encourages interaction, providing an environment that fosters learning.
          Blogs, wikis, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and podcasts are now common tools for learning in many educational institutions. Social media has contributed to the increase in long-distance online learning.
          Despite issues of lack of privacy and some instances of cheating among long-distance learners, this has not deterred social platforms from being used in education.

          <br />6. The moral challenges of social media
          Social media has been blamed for promoting social ills such as:

          <br />a. Cyberbullying

          Teenagers have a need to fit in, to be popular and to outdo others. This process was challenging long before the advent of social media. Add Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram into the mix and you suddenly have teenagers being subjected feeling pressure to grow up too fast in an online world.

          Michael Hamm, a researcher from the University of Alberta conducted a study that showed the effects of social media on bullying. 23% of teens report being targeted and 15 percent said they’d bullied someone on social media. Teenagers can misuse social media platforms to spread rumors, share videos aimed at destroying reputations and to blackmail others.

          <br />b. Lack of privacy
          Stalking, identity theft, personal attacks, and misuse of information are some of the threats faced by the users of social media. Most of the time, the users themselves are to blame as they end up sharing content that should not be in the public eye. The confusion arises from a lack of understanding of how the private and public elements of an online profile actually work.

          Unfortunately, by the time private content is deleted, it’s usually too late and can cause problems in people’s personal and professional lives.
        </div>
        <div class="tc-3">
          7. The impact of social media on personal relationships
          One of the effects of social media is encouraging people to form and cherish artificial bonds over actual friendships. The term ‘friend’ as used on social media lacks the intimacy identified with conventional friendships, where people actually know each other, want to talk to each other, have an intimate bond and frequently interact face to face.
          The bottom line
          It’s been said that information is power. Without a means of distributing information, people cannot harness the power. One positive impact of social media is in the distribution of information in today’s world. Platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and others have made it possible to access information at the click of a button.
          <br />Research conducted by parse.ly shows that the life expectancy of a story posted on the web is 2.6 days, compared to 3.2 days when a story is shared on social media. That’s a difference of 23%, which is significant when you consider that billions of people use the internet daily.
          <br />This means that the longer the information is in circulation, the more discussion it generates and the greater the impact of social media.
          While the world would be a much slower place without social media, it’s caused harm as well as good. However, the positive impact of social media is astronomical and far surpasses the ills associated with sharing.
          At the end of the day, sharing is about getting people to see and respond to content.<br /> As long as the content is still relevant and the need for information still exists, it’s always worthwhile for any organization using social media to keep publishing.

          <h2>Social media for children and teenagers</h2>
            <div class="text">
          Social media is a term for the online platforms that people use to connect with others, share media content, and form social networks. Some of the most popular platforms include Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest, Skype, YouTube, Viber and Snapchat.
          Online multiplayer games, like World of Warcraft, League of Legends, Clash of Clans and The Sims are also becoming important social media spaces for young people, where they connect with other gamers and chat while playing. Gaming chat sites are also popular ways for children and teenagers to connect with others who share their particular gaming interests.
          Using social media means uploading and sharing content. This includes:

          creating online profiles
          posting comments or chatting
          uploading photos and videos
          sharing links
          tagging photos and content
          creating and sharing game modifications
          remixing or changing existing content and sharing it.

          <h3>What your child gets from social media</h3>
          <div class="tc-3">
          Social media is a vital aspect of teenagers’ and children’s social and creative lives. They use social media to have fun, make and maintain friendships, share interests, explore identities and develop relationships with family. It’s an extension of their offline and face-to-face interactions.
          Social media can connect children and teenagers to online global communities based on shared interests. These might be support networks – for example, for young people with disability or medical conditions, teenagers who are same-sex attracted, or children from particular cultural backgrounds. Or they might be sites for commenting on and sharing content about particular interests like games, TV series, music or hobbies.
          Your child can get many other benefits from using social media:
          Digital media literacy: exploring and experimenting on social media can help your child build the knowledge and skills she needs to enjoy online activities and avoid online risks.
          Collaborative learning: your child can use social media to share educational content, either informally or in formal school settings.
          Creativity: your child can be creative with profile pages, photos and video, and modifications for games.
          Mental health and wellbeing: connecting with extended family and friends and taking part in local and global online communities can give your child a sense of connection and belonging.
         </div>
          <h3>Risks of social media</h3>
          <div class="tc-3">
          Social media sites can also pose risks. For your child, these risks include:

          being exposed to inappropriate or upsetting content like mean, aggressive, violent or sexual comments or images
          uploading inappropriate content like embarrassing or provocative photos or videos of himself or others
          sharing personal information with strangers – for example, phone numbers, date of birth or location
          cyberbullying
          exposure to too much targeted advertising and marketing
          data breaches, like having his data sold on to other organisations.
        </div>
          <h3>Navigating the risks of social media</h3>
          <div class="tc-3">
          Talking about social media use is the best way to protect your child and ensure her internet safety. Talking gives you the opportunity to help your child:
          work out how she wants to behave and be treated by other people online
          understand the risks involved in using social media – for example, risks like being tagged in an embarrassing photo taken at a party
          understand the dangers involved in sharing content and personal information – this includes not only content that your child shares but also images of your child that other people share, or posts and images that others tag your child to
          learn how to navigate the risks – for example, if your child posts an identifiable image of herself, she can reduce risk by not including any other personal information
          learn what to do if people ask for personal details, are mean or abusive online, post embarrassing photos of her, or share information that links back to her
          manage her own digital footprint – for example, you could talk about what your child would like her digital footprint to say about her now and in the future.
          Finding out more about social media
          Social media platforms and functionality are always changing so it’s a good idea to keep up to date with the social media your child uses. <br />You could ask your child what platforms are popular and which ones he likes. You could also get your child to show you how they work.
          You could consider checking whether your child’s social media choices are appropriate for her age. Some social media platforms have age restrictions. For example, to have a Facebook or Instagram account your child needs to be 13 years old.
          <br />But it’s often hard to enforce age restrictions on social media because it’s easy to lie about your age online. Also, many platforms don’t have specific age limits. Others, like online multiplayer game environments, let you interact with people of all ages all over the world.
          Some social media platforms now have versions for children, like YouTube Kids and Messenger Kids, which have different safety settings, require more parental involvement, and feature age-appropriate content. These platforms can help your child learn how to navigate social media.
          What about banning social media?
          <br />Social media is becoming increasingly embedded in apps, games, websites and even learning environments, so it’s hard to ban. And it usually doesn’t work to ban or block social media access anyway, even for younger children. It’s not a good way of teaching your child how to navigate social media risks and behave respectfully on social media.
          If you ban social media, your child might be more tempted to check it out when he’s away from home. Your child’s internet access away from home can be hard to control.
          </div>

          <h3>Setting up social media guidelines</h3>
          <div class="text">
          Some written guidelines about social media can help your child use social media responsibly, respectfully and safely.<br /> This agreement could be part of a family media plan. If these guidelines include your social media use as well as your child’s, you can be a positive role model.This might cover basics like:
        </div>


          <h3>Using social media </h3>

          <div class="text">
          when it’s OK to use social media and how long your child can spend on social media
          whether it’s OK to use social media during homework time, family meals and so on
          where it’s OK to use social media – for example, only in family areas of the house, not bedrooms.
          Posting content and comments
          It’s important for your child to agree to:

          not uploading or sharing inappropriate messages, images and video or herself or others
          being cautious about the information that she shares
          being a responsible digital citizen by showing respect in posts and when sharing content – for example, if it’s not OK to say or do something face to face, it’s not OK online.
          Protecting privacy
          There’s been a lot of concern about how large social media platforms like Facebook handle users’ data. It’s a good idea to go through privacy guidelines and settings with your child and make shared decisions about the platforms and privacy settings your child uses.
        </div>

          <h3>Your child can protect his privacy by agreeing to:</h3>
          <div class="text">
          not share personal information like phone numbers, location and date of birth with strangers online, or with people he doesn’t know personally
          not add personal details like phone numbers or date of birth to private profiles
          regularly check privacy and location settings, especially on mobile phones
          keep passwords and log-in details private and not share these with friends
          log out after using public computers
          disable features like posting to multiple social media sites at once.
          Staying safe on social media
        </div>
          <h3>Safety essentials for your child include:</h3>
          <div class="text">
          blocking and reporting people she doesn’t know or who post upsetting comments or content
          not clicking on pop-ups. <br />Some pop-ups that seem safe can lead to pornography sites or ask for personal or financial information
          accepting friend requests only from people your child knows to be who they say they are
          taking a screenshot and talking to a trusted adult about things she sees or experiences online that upset her.
