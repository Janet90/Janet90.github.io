        <p>Hello ... my name is Janet Aramian. I am studying at
          Monash university Bachelor of Communication Design.<br/>
          I enjoy using illustrator a lot and I am very interested
          in branding and designing invitations.<br />
          Using a combination of Illustrator and photoshop together
          gives me the ability to create a nice artwork combination.<br />
          I also enjoy coding websites. I have studied IT programming
          in the past and that gave me a good understanding of how to<br />
          merge my graphic design skills with the programming skills to make
          a good looking website yet a functional one!
